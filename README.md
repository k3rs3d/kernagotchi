This is a basic virtual pet game written in MicroPython. It's intended to run on a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, with a SSD1306 OLED display, 3 buttons, and a piezoelectric buzzer for sound.  

The concept is similar to the Tamagotchi device, which was a popular fad in the late 90's and early 00's. I've never actually owned a Tamagotchi myself, so I have no idea what I'm doing.
